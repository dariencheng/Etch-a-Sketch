UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM

- Create a javascript-based etch-a-sketch game from a 16x16 grid of square divs that changes color by cell when the user hovers their mouse over that cell. Include a button at the top that will clear the current grid and ask the user for how many squares per side to make a new grid (under the same container width)

PROJECT THOUGHTS
- Learned how to cleanly create a dynamic grid with CSS variables
- Became more comfortable with using JS to manipulate the DOM tree
